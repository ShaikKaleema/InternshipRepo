Problem statement 
You are given a string SS with length NN and you should change it to a palindrome using a sequence of zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two adjacent elements of SS (two characters) and swap them; however, neither of these elements may be used in any other operation.
Find the minimum number of operations you have to perform in order to change the string SS into a palindrome, or determine that it is impossible.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a single string SS with length NN.

Output
For each test case:
If it is impossible to make the string SS a palindrome, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain a single integer â€• the minimum required number of operations.'''
